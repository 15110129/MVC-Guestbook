MVC-Guestbook
=============

This is just a small "learning MVC project" where I'm building a guestbook in ASP.NET MVC 5

If you want to test it or continue development, just fork/zip-download, start up the project in Visual Studio and you're done.

I'm using a local MS SQL database, but you can just recreate the tables in any relational database of your liking and update the connection string in Web.Config.
